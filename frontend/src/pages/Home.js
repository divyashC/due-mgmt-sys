			<h1 className="custom">A "No Due" management system is like a digital assistant for our college, simplifying the way we handle and clear dues.
			 It keeps everyone in the loop by providing real-time updates, allowing students to check their dues, 
			 staff to add new ones, and administrators to keep an eye on the outstanding dues, all with ease. By 
			 going paperless and speeding up the dues clearance process, it helps create a more organized and efficient
			 college environment, ensuring that dues don't become a hassle for anyone.</h1>
